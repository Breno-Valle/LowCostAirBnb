# LowCostAirbnb

                                              "LOWCOST SOUTH AMERICA DREAMS"

This project is product of a Data Analysis and Machine Learning models with a very unique purpose: Help an imaginary travel agency ("Lowcost South America Dreams") to plan low cost travels to South America, in this cases, to Brazil, for thier clients. As part of that work we need to analyze some AirBnb locations in Rio de Janeiro and find the best possible places in city to indicate to the clients.

Our main objetives here are:

  -Find an avarege profile of the best possible places to find that is cheap and also with high quality (it means: great review scores)

  -Create a Machine Learning model who could predict if a new places, with no (or few) reviews, could be a good location for the clients, if its enjoyable, and if it's worth it..
 
 
 Our Dataset comes directly from AirBnb site and can be founded here: http://data.insideairbnb.com/brazil/rj/rio-de-janeiro/2020-10-25/data/listings.csv.gz
